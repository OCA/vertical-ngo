Sourcing with Framework Agreements
==================================

If you have a framework agreement negociated for the current product in
your logistic requisition, a sourcing of type "agreement" will be generated.

This sourcing allows the user to choose an agreement that will be used to
create directly a purchase order at the validation of the requisition. This
bypasses the tender flow.

Version 2.0 brings compatibility with version 2.0 of the module
framework_agreement, that introduced the concept of agreement portfolios.

Also, since 2.0 the choice of which agreement to use for a sourcing is up to
the user. The system will only propose an agreement if there is only one for
the portfolio, date, incoterm, and product selected.

Version 3.0, as you might expect, brings compatibility with version 3.0 of
framework_agreement. This makes the concept of agreements closer to standard
odoo pricelists, with the extra features of agreements added.
