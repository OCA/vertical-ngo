Automatically source logistic order from framework agreement
============================================================

If you have a framework agreement negociated for the current product in
your logistic requisition. If the date and state of agreement are OK,
agreement will be used as source for the concerned source lines
of your request.

In this case tender flow is byassed and confirmed PO will be generated
when logistic requisition is confirmed.

When confirming Logistic request sourcing lines are generating.
Generation process will look up all agreements with remaining quantity
and use them one after the other.

We will first choose cheapest agreements with price in negociated currency even
if they are cheaper in other currences.

Then we will choose remaining agreements ordered
by price converted in company currency.

You can prevent this behavior by forcing only one agreement per product at
the same time in company.
