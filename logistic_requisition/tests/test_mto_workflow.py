    """ Test the workflows of MTO products accross the models
    logistic requisition, to purchase orders, to sale orders
    passing through stock pickings.

    We create a logistic requisition for 100 products A.
    From there, we create a purchase requisition for these products.
    From the purchase requisition, we create one or several bids. We
    select lines to keep in the bids.

    From the logistic requisition (now sourced), we create a sales
    order. This sales order is confirmed, and the full complexity
    appears now. At the moment when the sales order is confirmed,
    a purchase quotation is generated (using the selected bid lines).

    The sales order lines created in this way are MTO and direct
    delivery (dropshipping). The procurement generated for these lines
    should be linked to the purchase quotation created before and not
    generate a new one. The stock move (reservation) of the procurement
    should be the same than the stock move generated for the Incoming
    Shipment of the purchase order.

    Finally, when the Incoming Shipment of the purchase order is done,
    the sales orders should be "delivered" and the purchase order
    should be "received" as well.

    In order to achieve that, when the procurement of the sales order line
    is generated, we leave the procurement as draft, we link it with the PO
    and we leave the move_id empty. Only at the moment when the picking
    of the purchase order is generated, we link the procurement's move_id
    to the picking's move and confirm the procurement.
