  I want to check the creation of delivery orders from a sale order
  I should have 1 delivery order per different address of locations
  in sale order lines. I create a stock location with an address.
-
  !record {model: stock.location, id: stock_location_01}:
    name: location_test_01
    location_id: stock.stock_location_company
    partner_id: base.res_partner_1
-
  I create a second stock location with another address
-
  !record {model: stock.location, id: stock_location_02}:
    name: location_test_02
    location_id: stock.stock_location_company
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
-
  I create a quotation with the locations in the lines
-
  !record {model: sale.order, id: sale_order_with_locations_01}:
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    order_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_22
        product_uom_qty: 10
        location_id: stock_location_01
      - product_id: product.product_product_22
        product_uom_qty: 10
        location_id: stock_location_02
      - product_id: product.product_product_22
        product_uom_qty: 10
        location_id: stock_location_01
-
  Now I confirm the Quotation sale_order_with_locations_01
-
  !workflow {model: sale.order, action: order_confirm, ref: sale_order_with_locations_01}
-
  I check that 1 delivery order per address has been generated
-
  !python {model: sale.order}: |
    sale_order = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("logistic_requisition.sale_order_with_locations_01"))
    pickings = sale_order.picking_ids
    assert len(pickings) == 2, (
        "Sale order should have 2 delivery orders, got %d" % len(pickings))
