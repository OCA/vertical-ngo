This module isolates budget dimension about Logistic Requisitions.
===================================================================

A Logistic requisition express a need that is requested somewhere. It allows to 
manage the sourcing of the needs before making a cost estimate to the requestor.

This invert the logic that is in standard in OpenERP in the way that the sourcing 
of the procuremnt is made before the order confirmation and we built the link incase 
of validation. In standard, th SO confirmation generate the procurement then it
generate the needed procurement.
